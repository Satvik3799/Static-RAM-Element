Memory is the portion of a computer or other system that store binary data. In a computer, memory is accessed millions of times per second, so the requirement for speed and accuracy is paramount, Very fast semiconductor memory is available today in modules with several GB of capacity. These large â€“memory modules use exactly the same operating principles as smaller units, so we are using smaller ones for illustration.
